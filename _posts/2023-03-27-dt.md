If you've taken a proofs course, a logic course from your philosophy department, or had any 
introduction to symbolic logic, you may have seen an inference rule that looks something like this:
\\[
\begin{aligned}
& \begin{aligned}
& \begin{aligned}
1.\quad& A \\
?.\quad& \dots \\
n-1.\quad& B
\end{aligned} \\
n.\quad& A \to B
\end{aligned} & \qquad & \begin{aligned}
& \text{Assumption} \\
& \text{???} \\
& \text{Some Rule: 1...$n-1$} \\
& \qquad \text{Conditional Proof}
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}
\\]
Conditional proofs are an essential part of proof systems, and mathematics in general. It allows us to 
prove mathematical properties without yet knowing whether our assumption is actually true, and string
some of these proofs together in such a way that the proof of one assumption (conditional) potentially 
leads to the truth of several other statements.
