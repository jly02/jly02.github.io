Hi! I'm Jonathan, a recent student from the University of Washington Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering. I am interested in theoretical computer science broadly, particularly computability and complexity theory, logic and programming languages, and formal methods in software. Secondarily, I dabble in areas of applied mathematics, particularly modeling of complex systems and numerical methods. 

I have been a researcher, developer, teaching assistant, and business analyst. Adaptability and clear communication are important to me, and so are deliberate thinking and careful engineering. I consider myself a lifelong learner, and strive to continuously improve my own knowledge and skills while challenging myself in different environments.
